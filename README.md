Tipping application designed for any and all users!

Project group: Solo

Code Reviewer: Eric Groom

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this app, Tippy, will provide a simple UI for users who simply need to quickly calculate an accurate tip to be used for big or small groups. This application will provide a basic yet modern designed interface that allows users to calculate necessary tip onto their phones in any dining situation, and it will also split it among the parties.

Calculator: Creating/Removing to do: About 2-3 hours to create the basic structure and to really learn the types of functions we are utilizing for the application.

Input output fields: 45 minutes to implement a nice input output design with a friendly design.

Ability to split with other people: 1-2 hours to learn how to utilize the splitting

Modern and minimal design: 2-3 hours creating a nice and simplistic design, utilizing roommates as a focus group and getting their input.
